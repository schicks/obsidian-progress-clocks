## Types of Counters

### Clock

"Clocks" (or "progress clocks") are pie-chart-style counters with a configurable
number of segments, useful for tracking progress/steps. They were introduced in
the [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks) RPG by
[John Harper](https://twitter.com/john_harper).

### Counter

A number (defaulting to zero) with increment/decrement buttons next to it. You
can enter an exact number, or `+/-` in order to add/subtract from the current
value.

### Stopwatch

Keeps track of time.
